## Overview

SPIDAM (Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling) is a project designed to address the challenge of voice intelligibility in enclosed spaces. The project focuses on creating an interactive data analysis and modeling platform using Python. This platform allows users to import, clean, visualize, analyze, and model data related to reverberation time (RT60) in acoustic environments.

## Purpose

Large enclosed spaces, if not acoustically treated, may have long reverberation times, which can impair voice intelligibility. SPIDAM aims to provide a solution by enabling users to:

- Record sound samples in enclosed spaces.
- Analyze the recorded data using scientific computations in Python.
- Visualize and model the reverberation time over different frequency ranges.
- Implement appropriate acoustic treatment to reduce RT60 and enhance voice intelligibility.
